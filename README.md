# Model

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/DAddYE/model?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/DAddYE/model)

General purpose utilities for the go `struct`.

It uses `reflect`, however we cache the result when you allocate the `model`.

## Install

```go
import "github.com/daddye/model"
```

## Usage:

1. Define your `struct`
2. `tag` it. Each tag will map the field to the column name

```go
type User struct {
	Id     int  `sql:"id"`
	Age    int  // not mapped
	Gender byte // not mapped

	// works with embedded structs
	Bio struct {
		Name    string `sql:"name"`
		Surname string `sql:"last_name"`
	}
}
```

create a pointer and add some data:

```go
user := new(User)
user.Id = 9
user.Age = 30
user.Gender = 'm'
user.Bio.Name = "Stan"
user.Bio.Surname = "Smith"
```

now create a model for this struct:

```go
m := model.New(user, "sql")
```

now you can check, tag names:

```go
m.TagNames() // => [id name last_name]
```

values:

```go
m.Values() // => [9 Stan Smith]
```

you're free to change your values anytime:

```go
user.Bio.Name = "Francine"
m.Values() // => [9 Francine Smith]
```

you have access to `reflect.Value`:

```go
m.Reflections()
```

as well interfaces:

```go
m.Interfaces()
```

this, is especially useful when you want to bind `data` to your `struct`, for example, if you're
using `database/sql` you can:

```go
db.QueryRow("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1", 9).Scan(m.Interfaces()...)
```

since query string construction is a common pattern, I have added a type `Query` to deal with it.

So you can rewrite the latter better using our type
[Query](https://godoc.org/github.com/DAddYE/model#Query):

```go
table := "users"
query := model.Query{"SELECT", m.TagNames(), "FROM", table, "WHERE id=$1"}
// query => "SELECT id, name, last_name FROM users WHERE id=$1"

db.QueryRow(query.String(), 9).Scan(m.Interfaces()...)
```

You can create your own DB custom queries like:

```go
func (s *People) InsertQuery() string {
  return model.Query{
    "INSERT INTO people (", s.TagNames(), ") VALUES (", s.Repeat("?") ")",
  }.String()
}

func (s *People) UpdateQeury(condition string) string {
  return model.Query{
    "UPDATE people SET", s.Assign(), "WHERE", condition,
  }.String()
}
```
