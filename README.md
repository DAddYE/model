# Model

This is a naive, very small way to map `something` to a `struct`.

It works well for example with the standard package `database/sql`, but also others like
`cassandra/cql` should be fine.

It uses `reflections`, but only **once**, in particular during the allocation time.

It is very cheap because as the standard library, you allocate **once** an then you'll **reuse**
your `var` to bind the result.

Instead to use the `interface` approach in order to avoid type assertions or reflection (when
binding the result) this package use `embedded structs` to achieve a similar result.

## Install

```go
import "github.com/daddye/model"
```

## Usage:

### Definition

1. Define your model type (Usually the name of a Table)
2. `tag` it. Each tag will map the field to the column name
3. Embed the `Model` type.

```go
import "github.com/daddye/model"

type Feed struct {
	Id               int    `sql:"id"`
	SoruceFileFormat string `sql:"source_file_format"`
	SourceType       string `sql:"source_type"`
	Ftp              Ftp
	model.Model      // <<<< this
}
```

You can embed many structs as you want in this case `FTP` is a separate one:

```go
type Ftp struct {
	FileName string `sql:"source_ftp_file_name"`
	Username string `sql:"source_ftp_username"`
}
```

### Allocation

You must provide an allocation function in order to allow `Model` to derive/map the struct's fields
to the sql counterpart:

```go
func NewFeed(db *sql.DB) (f *Feed) {
	f = new(Feed)
	f.DB = db
	f.Table = "feeds"
	model.Set(f, "sql")
	return
}
```

Here you have done few things:

1. Allocation of the struct (as usual)
2. Map the struct with a `connection`
3. Set the table where the struct `Feed` will refer to.
4. Map the struct's fields with their tags and setup a `Value` to use later.

### Interface

At this point you need to define the `interface` (it's not really that and it's not mandatory) so you
may want to fetch `one` or `multi` row(s), you can now define your functions as:

```go
func (f *Feed) First(conditions string, args ...interface{}) error {
  m := &f.Model
	query := model.Query{"SELECT", m.Columns, "FROM", m.Table, conditions, "LIMIT 1"}

	m.Err = m.DB.QueryRow(query.String(), args...).Scan(m.Values...)
	return m.Err
}

func (f *Feed) Find(conditions string, args ...interface{}) (*model.Iter, error) {
  m := &f.Model
	query := model.Query{"SELECT", m.Columns, "FROM", m.Table, conditions}

	rows, err := m.DB.Query(query.String(), args...)
	if err != nil {
		m.Err = err
		return nil, err
	}

	iter := model.Iter{Model: m, Rows: rows}
	return &iter, nil
}
```

__SIDE NOTE: What is `Query`? Nothing complicated, just a little helper to `Join(something, ", ")`,
check it out on [model.go](/model.go)__

Since it's a quite common pattern we provide (and you can do it too) `generics` functions. So for
`database/sql` you can `import query "github.com/daddye/model/sql"` and write just that:

```go
func (f *Feed) First(conditions string, args ...interface{}) error {
	return query.First(&f.Model, conditions, args...)
}

func (f *Feed) Find(conditions string, args ...interface{}) (*model.Iter, error) {
	return query.Find(&f.Model, conditions, args...)
}
```

### Usage

Now you can use it on a single row:

```go
db, err := sql.Open("postgres", "user=... dbname=... sslmode=disable")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
defer db.Close()

feed := NewFeed(db)
err = feed.First("WHERE ID = $1", 123)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Print(err)
	return
}
fmt.Printf("Id: %d, FileName: %s\n", feed.Id, feed.Ftp.Username)
```

For multiple results instead you can do:

```go
db, err := sql.Open("postgres", "user=... dbname=... sslmode=disable")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
defer db.Close()

feed := NewFeed(db)
rows, err := feed.Find("WHERE source_type = 'ftp'")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Print(err)
	return
}
for rows.Next() {
	fmt.Printf("Id: %d, FileName: %s\n", feed.Id, feed.Ftp.Username)
}
```
